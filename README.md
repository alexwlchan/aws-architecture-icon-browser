# aws-architecture-icon-browser

AWS publish the [AWS Architecture Icons][icons], a collection of product and service icons that you can use in architecture diagrams.
I normally download the asset package, which contains PNG and SVG icons.

This is a small web app that lets me look for icons by name, rather than poking through files and folders:

![A screenshot of the browser. There are three headings 'Architecture' 'Category' and 'Resource', and a filter applied for the keyword 'network', which shows a collection of red, orange and purple icons. Icons are shown on the left-hand side, with their name and a list of sizes on the right.](screenshot.png)

I'm sure there are better ways to look at an icon collection if you use professional diagramming software, but I don't have much experience in those tools.
(I use OmniGraffle, but only about 1% of what it can do.)
